# 🚗 Smart Parking Management System (SPMS)
*Microservice-Based Application*

## 📋 Overview

The Smart Parking Management System (SPMS) is a cloud-native, microservice-based platform that solves urban parking challenges through real-time management and monitoring of parking spaces. Users can locate, reserve, and pay for parking while parking owners manage spaces dynamically.

## 🚨 Business Problem

Urban parking challenges include traffic congestion, fuel wastage, emissions, and reduced mobility. Manual and static systems are inefficient and non-scalable.

## ✅ Solution

SPMS provides:
- 🎯 Dynamic space allocation and real-time tracking
- 💳 Digital transactions and booking receipts
- 📈 Scalable microservice architecture
- 🌐 IoT integration capabilities
